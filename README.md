This is the Frontend of the assignement of Paul Le Picart for the course on Full Stack Development at OTH

It is built on top of the donation-svelte. In addition to donation-svelte:

- it is deployed on netlify: https://mellow-speculoos-430321.netlify.app/
- the donation list page has been replaced by an admin user list page (admin is Marge)
- there are several linked maps
- on the maps, each popup has a gallery of images
- users can select the type of the charts in the relevant page
